    Scheduler:
        Base class for all of the scheduling algorithms.

        The idea behind this class is that it provides the base functionality for the scheduling algorithms.
        The class provides virtual functions because we are going to override them in our derived classes,
        for example, a derived class will be used for the first come, first served algorithm.
